### **Prompt 1: Setting Up Firebase and Integrating It with Flutter**

**Project Rundown:**

I'm building a family gift list app using Flutter and Firestore (Firebase). The app allows family members to create and share their gift lists. When someone gets an item from a person's list, the item remains visible to the owner but is marked or hidden from other users to prevent duplicate gifts. The app is currently a PWA (Progressive Web App) built with Flutter.Please approach this as a principle software engineer leading the project? I will drive the implementation, and will learn what the best steps are in the process.
